# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#require 'factory_girl_rails'

#10.times do
 # a = FactoryGirl.create :user
  #  FactoryGirl.create :store, :user => a

#end


#10.times do
# FactoryGirl.create :product
#end

#10.times do
 # FactoryGirl.create :store_with_product_user
#end
